    JavaScript is a progamming language that adds custom behavior to your web page.
  </h1>
  <p>
    With JavaScript,
    you can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Change the style of any element</li>

        <li>Show and hide elements</li>
          <li>Make events happen in response to user actions or at specific time intervals</li>
          <li>Play sounds</li>
            <li>and more</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There is a JS library called <a href="https://jquery.com/">JQuery </a>that makes these things even easier to do,
             but we won't use it here.</p>
            <p class="boxed">
              For example, on the last page, clicking the button made a text box appear.  It was actually there
              along (take a look at the HTML source), but hidden by the CSS file.  The JavaScript file added functionality to the button
              to change the visibility of the div (section) holding that text.  It also lowered the opacity of the rest of the page, making it lighter by constrast.</p>
              <p>On this page, you should have first seen animated text and heard music playing.  That's also a result of a JavaScript file.
                To view the file for either page, look at the source and click on the link to the .js file (near the end of the body).
