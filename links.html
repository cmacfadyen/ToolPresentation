  Creating hyperlinks
</h1>
<p>Making your activity interactive begins with hyperlinks.  You can write several html files, each of which will
  display a page.  Hyperlinking words or phrases (or even images) on one page will bring the user to another page.
   To add a link to text on a page,
   <!-- This is how to write a "comment."  It has no effect on the web page. If you're wondering about
 the &lt;a&gt; below, it's just a way to get a < and > to print as text, rather than act as tags-->
  surround that text with an &lt;a&gt; tag.  &lt;a&gt; stands for "anchor."</p>
   Take a look at the source code (Ctrl-U or Cmd-U)
  for this page to see <a href="index.html">how to link to another page on your site</a><br>
You can also link to external web pages, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp">like so </a><br><br>or
  to images <br>
  <a href="linked.html"><img src="links.jpg" width = 300px></a>(Image used with permisson from pixabay.com)
<br><br>
  You can even link to specific areas within an image by using an "image map."  <a href="https://www.image-map.net/">Here's a tool
  </a>that creates the map for you.  Define each area, then put in the appropriate link.  Imagine a picture of a room, where
   clicking on different doors in the room takes the user to other rooms, for example, or where clicking on an object links
   to a page with a "zoomed-in" view of that object.

<h3>Before continuing, think about how you might structure your story as a group of pages that link to one another. How might you
  organize the navigation?</h3>
<br>
So...you now can create multiple pages that link to one another.  But can't we make them look a little nicer
than this? We can! <a href="styling.html">Click here to learn how</a>
