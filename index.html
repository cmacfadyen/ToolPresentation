<h1>Creating learner experiences with HTML, CSS, and JS</h1>
<p font-style="italic">[I know, I know... this page doesn't look great.  But hang in there- we'll get there!]</p>
<h2>There are many helpful tools available for designing learner experiences, however you
  may want to consider building something "from scratch." </h2>
<p font-weight="strong">  Biggest pro: you can design the activity exactly as you want it<br/>
  Biggest con: it can be a lot of work</p><br>
  <p>What you're looking at is a simple web page, coded using only HTML.
    The process is:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Open a text editor (such as Atom, Sublime, Notepad++)</li>
      <li>Create a text file with HTML "tags" (more on that in a bit)</li>
      <li>Save the file with the extension .html or .htm</li>
      <li>To view the file, use Ctrl-O or Cmd-O to open the file in any browser (note that
        you'll need to refresh each time you save new changes to the file)</li>
    </ul>
  <br><p>Take a look at the actual code for this page by
    choosing "View Source" in your browser (typically, Ctl-U on a PC or Cmd-U on Mac, or via the menu). <br>
    After studying the code, come back to this page and click <a href="basics.html">here</a></p>
