  <h1>Doesn't this look a little better?</h1>
<!--what's a "div"?  It's a tag used to divide the page into sections that can be styled as a group -->
  <div id="main">
<p>Check out the source code for this page.  While the body looks similar to the other pages, note
  that in the head, we link to a file called style.css.  </p>
  <!-- and here's how you insert an image -->
  <img src="horizontal.png" width = "100%" height="80px">
  <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets."  In a CSS file, we define all the visual properties we want
  to apply to our page.  <a href="style.css" target="_blank"> Here's a link to the file </a> for this page (you can also get there by viewing
  the source).</p>
  <p id="CSS-def">
    A CSS file can set the style for all elements of a certain type (e.g. all paragraphs), elements that have
     been assigned a particular id (like this paragraph), or elements that have been assigned to a particular
     "class" like the next one.  Use an id to uniquely target an element; use a class to place the element within
      a group of other like-styled elements</p>
  <p class = "boxed">
    You can use the same stylesheet (another name for a css file) for several pages, giving your site a
    coherent, themed look (and saving you a lot of time). Here's the <a href="indexwstyle.html">introduction page (index.html)</a>
     with the same stylesheet applied, for example. Our friends at W3 Schools have a whole section on
    CSS, as well, so that's a good place to get started.
