<h1>Creating learner experiences with HTML, CSS, and JS</h1>
<p>[I know, I know... this page doesn't look great.  But hang in there- we'll get there!]</p>
<p>There are many helpful tools available for designing learner experiences, however you
  may want to consider building something "from scratch." </p>
<p>  Biggest pro: you can design the activity exactly as you want it<br/>
  Biggest con: it can be a lot of work</p>
  <p>What you're looking at is a simple web page, coded using only HTML.  Take a look at the actual code by
    choosing "View Source" in your browser (typically, Ctl-U on a PC or Cmd-U on Mac). After studying
  the code, come back to this page and click <a href="basics.html">here</a></p>
