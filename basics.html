  <h1>HTML basics</h1>
  <p> HTML (hypertext markup language) uses tags (contained within angle brackets)
    to let the browser know what to display (and how). You
    probably noticed several &lt;p&gt; tags in the source code for the
      previous page (index.html), for example.  These indicate the start
    of a new paragraph.  The end of the paragraph is indicated by the closing &lt;/p&gt; tag.<br>
     The basic structure of any page is a "head" section, where you'll put the title of the
      page and sometimes load other files (more on that later).  What the viewer actually sees on the page
      is contained in the "body."</p> <br>
      <h3>Here's a template for a basic page:</h3><br>
      <p style="font-family:Courier,monospace;">
    &lt;html&gt;<br>
    &lt;head&gt;<br>
    &lt;title&gt;<br>
    Name to display in the browser tab<br>
    &lt;/title&gt;<br>
    &lt;/head&gt;<br>
    &lt;body&gt;<br>
    Content of the page.  <br>
    &lt;/body&gt;<br>
    &lt;/html&gt;<br>
    <br><br></p>
    <p>Within the body, Use &lt;h1&gt; for headings (h2, h3, etc are smaller subheadings) and &lt;p&gt;
    for normal (paragraph) text. Note that a tag is "closed" using a forward slash.  This lets the browser
    know when, for example, a paragraph is complete.
     One exception to this is the &lt;br&gt; tag, because it
    does not enclose any content-- it simply produces a line break.
    Tags can be nested inside of other tags.  For example, there are many tags opened and closed within
    the body, which itself is within the HTML<br>
