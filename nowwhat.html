<h1>So how can you use these tools?</h1>
<p>
  Think of a story that branches, or where one discovery leads to another.
  Create HTML pages that link to reveal the next part of the story.
  Make a CSS style sheet to get a consistent, appealing look.
  Add JS to create animations and other effects.

  Here's a suggested work process:
  <ul>
    <li>Write your files in a text editor (I'm using Atom)</li>
    <li>Create a folder to put all your files in (you can make subfolders for images and other media,
      if desired)</a>
    <li>Open the files in Firefox (which has excellent developer tools)</li>
    <li>Open a different browser so you can look things up-- you'll do that a lot! (again,
      <a href= "https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> is helpful, as is
      <a href= "https://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Network</a>)</li>
    <li>To share your finished product, create a repository at GitHub and turn on
      <a href="https://pages.github.com/"> GitHub pages</a></li>
